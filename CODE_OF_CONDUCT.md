## Our Pledge

We write code. If you're interested in writing code, we can probably get along. We foster an actual open environment around these parts, which means you WILL read things that make you mad and we're not going to do anything at all about it. We don't care at all about your age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. By this we mean none of the above are going to get you any special consideration. Trying to get special consideration for them will get you the boot though.

## Our Standard

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Writing good code.
* Knowing how to use git.
* Using tabs for indentation instead of spaces.
* Having a sense of humor or at least thick skin.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using spaces instead of tabs for indentation.
* Not letting people know on IRC when you are monkeying with dev.
* Using emacs.
* Bitching about other people on the team.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will do so by publicly berating you or kicking your ass to the curb as warranted.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in project areas only. We don't care if you're a transvestite Nazi that goes door to door preaching the greatness of Cthulhu in your personal life.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior should be reported on IRC. Preferably in #soylent where everyone can see what a whiny little turd you are. All complaints will either be ignored or get you shown to the door, entirely at the whim of whatever maintainer is around.

## Attribution

This code of conduct is intended to mock the Contributor Covenant. Any similarities are entirely intentional and anything that might be considered derisive most assuredly was meant to be.
